control flow is basically deals conditioal statement, if statement, making decisions in the program, repeating code(loops).
fundemantal programing techniques!
meaning of over flow is that the statement inside your source file are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear.
control flow statement however break up the flow of execution by employing decision making.
looping and branching enabling your program contidionally execute particular block of code.
*decision making statement(if-then. then-else, switch-goto)
*looping statement(for, while, do-while)
*branching statement(break,continue,return)

decision making meaning
structures requires that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program.
if the condition is true then a statement or statements are executed.
of a condition is false then other statement are executed.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statement multiple times.

loop control statemetn change execution from its normal secquence when execution leaves a scope, all automatic object that were 
created in that scope are destroyed.(break and continue)

a loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes false, the for loop is traditionally used for this purpose.
