sometimes you need to use a constant in a program
circumference=3.14159*diameter;
the constant 3.14159 represent the world famous constant pi.
there are good reasons to use symbolic constant instead of just typing in the number a name tell you more than numbe does
if you read through a long program the meanning of the second version is plainer.
suppose you have used a constant in several places and it becomes necessary to change its value
you only need to alter the defenition of the symbolic constant rather than find and change every occurence of the constant in the program


the prepocessor let you define constants
when your program is compiled the value 0.015 will be substituted everywhere you have  use TAXRATE.
compile time substitution
a defined name is not a variable
you cannot assign a value to it 
notice that #define statement has special syntax 
no equal sigh used to assigh the value 0.015 to TAXRATE
no semicolon.

define statemnet can appear anywhere in program 
nosuch thing as local define
most programmees groups their #define statement at the beginning of the program(or inside an include file)
where they can be quickly referenced and shared by more than one source file

the#define statement helps to make programs more portable.
it might be necessary to use constant values that are related to the particular computer in which the program is running.

the define statement can be used for characters and string constants

#define BEEP '\a';
define TEE 'T'
#define ESC '\033'
define OOPS "now you have done it"
