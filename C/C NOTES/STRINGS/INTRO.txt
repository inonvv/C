A string constat or string literal is a sequence of chracters or symbols betwwen a pair of double qute charaters
anything between a  pair of double quotes is interpeted by the compiler as a string.
includes any special charaters and embedded spaces.
anything in doublue quotes is a string.which is a  text.
every time you have displayed a message using the printf function you have defined the 
message as a string

understand the difference between single qutation and double quotation marks.
both are used to create two different type of constants in C
single quotes for characters
double quotes for strings
for the third example above you must specify a double quote within a string as the escape sequence.
the compiler will interpret an explicit double quotes without preceding backslash as a string delimiter

null charater 
a special character with the code value 0 is added to the end of each string to mark where it ends
this charater is known as the null charater and you write it as \0
a string is always terminated by a null charater,so the length of a string is always one greater than a number of charaters strings
example
int main(void)
{
printf("the charater \ is used to terminate a string");

}

if you compile and run this program you will get this output:
the character
the only first part if the string has been displayed 
outouts ends after the fist two word because the function stops outputting the string 
when it reaches it first null charater
the second \0 art the end of the string will never be reachred
