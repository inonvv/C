a function is a self cointained unit of program code desogned to accomplish a particular task
syntax rules define the structure if function and how it can be used.
function in C is the same as subortines or procedures in other programming languages
some function cause an action to take place like printf or scanf two differce action.
some functions find a value for program to use strlen() tells a program how long a certain string is.
advatages of functions
allow for the divide and conquer strategy 
it is very difficult to write an entire program as a single large main function
difficult to test debug and maintain.
with divide and conquer tasks can be divied into several independent subtasks
reduce the overall complexity
separate function are written for each subtask.
we can further divide each subtask into smaller subtasks further reducing the complexity.
reduce duplication of code
save you time when writing testing and debugging code
reduces the size of the source code 
if you have to do a certain task several times in a program you only need to write an appropriate function once
program can then use that function wherever needed
you can also use the same function un diffenrent program.
help with readability
is better orginazed 
easier to fix and change
the divide and conquer approach also the parts of program to be developed tested, and debugged independently
reduce the iverall development time
 the function developed for one program can be used un another program
software reuse
many programmers like to think of a function as a black box
information that goes in
the value or action it produces

uisng the black box thinking helps you concentrate on the program overall design rather than the details 
what the function should fo and how it relates to the programas a whole

example
#define SIZE50
int main()
{
  float list[size]
  readlist(list,SIZE);
  sort(list,SIZE);
  average(list,SIZE);
  return 0;
}

implemeting function
rememner just calling functions does not work unless we implement the function itself.
user defined function
we would have to write the code for the three functions readlist(),sort(),and average() in our previous examples
always use descriptive function names to make it clear what the program does and how it is organized
if you can make the function general enough you can reuse them in other programs
 we will understad how to
difine functions
invoke functions
how to pass and return data from them
