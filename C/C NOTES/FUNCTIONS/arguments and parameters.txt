a parameter is variable in a function declaration and function definition/implementation.

when  a function is called the argumnets are the data you pass into the function parameters.
the actual value of a variable that gets passed to the function.

function parameters are defined within the funcion header
are placeholders for arguments that need to be specified when the function is called

the parameters for a function are a list of parameters names with their types each parameter is separated 
by a comma.
entire list of parameters is enclosed betwenn the parantheses thta follow the function name.
a function can have no parameters, in which case you should put void between the parentheses.
parameters provide the means to pass data to a function
data passed fro, calling function to the funcion that is called
the names of the parameters are local to the function they will assume the values of the 
arguments that are passed when the function is called.
the body of the function should use these parameters in its implementation.
a function body may have additional locally defined variables that are needed by the functions implemetataion.
when the prinf() function  is called, you always supply one or more values as arguments 
first value being the format string
the remaining values being any variables to displayed
parameterrs greatly increase the usefulness and the flexibility of a function 
the printf() function displays whatever you tell it to display via parameters and arguments passed
its a good  idea to add comments before each of your own function definitions
help explain what the function does and how the arguments are to be used.

example
#include<stdio.h>

void multiplyTwoNumbers(int x,int y)
{
  int result=x*y;
  printf("the product of %d multiplied by %d is:\n",x,y,result);
}

int main(void)
{
 multiplyTwoNumbers(10,20)
 multiplyTwoNumbers(20,30);
 multiplyTwoNumbers(50,2);

return 0;
}
